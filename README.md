# Fact-Check  
Truth Through Transparency

Fact-Check is an AI-powered fact-checking platform that combats misinformation in technology journalism through multi-source verification. It analyzes how multiple credible publications report the same technology news, extracts verifiable claims, and evaluates their credibility using Generative AI.

Built entirely on Google’s AI and cloud ecosystem, Fact-Check delivers real-time, transparent, and explainable credibility assessments for technology-related articles.

## Overview
Technology journalism often publishes bold claims about products, launches, or announcements based on limited or single-source reporting. Readers and investors usually lack efficient tools to verify whether these claims are accurate.

Fact-Check addresses this gap by comparing multiple sources, validating claims using AI, and presenting clear, evidence-based verification results. The platform is designed for educational use, research, and hackathon demonstrations, with a strong focus on transparency and responsible AI.

## Problem Statement
Technology journalism is increasingly affected by unverified claims and single-source reporting. This creates challenges such as:

- Difficulty verifying article accuracy across multiple credible sources  
- Rapid spread of exaggerated or misleading information  
- Poor decision-making by readers and investors  
- Loss of trust in digital journalism platforms  

These issues impact both financial decision-making (FinTech) and information credibility, making it a suitable problem for Generative AI–based solutions.

## Solution
Fact-Check provides an automated, AI-driven solution that:

- Collects technology articles from multiple sources  
- Compares how different publications report the same story  
- Extracts and verifies factual claims using AI  
- Assigns transparent credibility scores  
- Provides explainable, evidence-based insights  

The system transforms single-perspective reporting into trustworthy, multi-source verification.

## System Architecture
Fact-Check follows a **multi-agent AI architecture**, where each agent performs a specific responsibility in the verification pipeline:

1. **Tech Articles Input**  
   - APIs, RSS feeds, and technology journalism websites  

2. **Multi-Source Collection**  
   - Gathers the same article from multiple publications  

3. **Claim Extraction (AI)**  
   - Identifies key claims and announcements  

4. **News Verification Agent**  
   - Cross-verifies claims with credible sources  
   - Assigns confidence scores  

5. **Decision Layer**  
   - Classifies content as Verified or Not Verified  

6. **Financial & Market Impact Analysis**  
   - Evaluates relevance, sentiment, and potential market impact  

7. **Insight Generation**  
   - Produces clear, explainable credibility assessments  

8. **User Dashboard / API**  
   - Delivers real-time results to users

## How It Works
1. Technology articles are continuously collected from multiple sources  
2. AI extracts factual claims from each article  
3. Claims are cross-verified using trusted publications  
4. Credibility scores are calculated  
5. Market relevance is analysed  
6. Transparent insights are delivered in real time
